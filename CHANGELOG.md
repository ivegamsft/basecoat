## 3.23.0 - 2026-05-09

### Multi-Agent Guidance Management (#614-617)

Implements multi-agent strategy research and two new creator-verifier agents.

#### docs/research/multi-agent-strategy-matrix.md

Maps 8 BaseCoat operational tasks to best-fit agent patterns using the
Eisenhower x Cynefin framework and Decision Book models. Includes a pattern
selection decision tree.

#### docs/research/multi-agent-bmc.md

Business Model Canvas for the BaseCoat multi-agent system. Covers value
propositions, customer segments, channels, revenue streams (measured in
adoption and knowledge quality), key activities, and cost structure.

#### agents/guidance-author.agent.md

Creator agent that drafts new BaseCoat guidance assets (instructions, skills,
agents, prompts) from a plain-language description. Handoffs to
guidance-reviewer for validation.

#### agents/guidance-reviewer.agent.md

Verifier agent that validates guidance drafts against lint rules, frontmatter
schema, required sections, and BaseCoat conventions. Returns structured
PASS/FAIL verdict with line-level findings. Handoffs back to guidance-author
on FAIL for correction.

#### docs/architecture/multi-agent-orchestration-patterns.md

Added two new patterns: Creator-Verifier Loop (with LangGraph StateGraph
implementation and conditional retry edges) and Pub-Sub Broadcast for memory
promotion events (event schema, publisher/subscriber templates,
repository_dispatch wiring).

### Ops

- **basecoat-memory validate.yml** (#619): improved PR validation — now checks
  all required fields (subject, fact, citations, confidence), detects duplicate
  subjects within a PR, and validates fact length (max 300 chars)
- **Sprint 20-22 memories contributed** (#618): 7 memories submitted to
  basecoat-memory via the callable workflow (ci, git, authoring, process, memory
  domains)

## 3.22.0 - 2026-05-09

### Enterprise Onboarding (#623)

Reduces internal friction to near-zero. After a one-time admin step, any
IBuySpy-Shared repo can contribute learnings with a single command.

#### docs/memory/SETUP-INTERNAL.md

Internal org guide. Admin sets `MEMORY_REPO_TOKEN` as an org-level Actions
secret once; every repo in the org inherits it automatically with no per-repo
configuration.

#### docs/memory/SETUP-EXTERNAL.md

External org step-by-step guide covering PAT creation, org-level vs per-repo
secret options, onboarding script usage, callable workflow copy-paste, token
rotation, and a troubleshooting table.

#### scripts/onboard-basecoat.sh

One-command enlistment. Adds the `basecoat-enabled` topic and creates the
three learning labels. Infers repo from git remote if `--repo` is omitted.
Idempotent - safe to re-run.

#### .github/workflow-templates/submit-learning.yml

Org starter workflow. Appears in the **Actions - New workflow** UI for all
`IBuySpy-Shared` repos automatically. No file copy needed - fill form, run.

#### .github/workflows/auto-enlist.yml

Admin bulk-enlistment workflow. Accepts a comma-separated repo list or sweeps
the entire org. Defaults to `dry_run: true` for safety.

## 3.21.0 - 2026-05-09

### Lower Contribution Barriers (#622)

Consumer repos can now contribute learnings via five distinct paths with
progressively lower tooling requirements:

| Path | Requirements |
|---|---|
| Label issue/PR | `basecoat-enabled` topic (already exists) |
| GitHub issue form | GitHub account only — zero local tools |
| Reusable workflow | One workflow file + repo secret |
| `submit-learning.sh` | `bash`, `curl`, `jq`, PAT |
| `submit-learning.ps1` | PowerShell, `gh` CLI, PAT |

#### scripts/submit-learning.sh

Bash equivalent of `submit-learning.ps1`. Uses the GitHub REST API directly —
no `git clone`, no `gh` CLI, no PowerShell. Works on any Linux/macOS environment
with `bash`, `curl`, and `jq`.

#### .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/memory-contribution.yml

Structured issue form with scope-check boxes as required fields. Zero setup —
any GitHub user can open an issue on the basecoat repo and the bot handles the rest.

#### .github/workflows/memory-contribution-issue.yml

Bot workflow triggered when an issue receives the `memory-contribution` label.
Parses the structured form fields, validates scope and format, pushes a candidate
to `basecoat-memory/sweep-candidates/`, and comments back with confirmation.

#### .github/workflows/submit-learning-callable.yml

`workflow_call` + `workflow_dispatch` reusable workflow. Consumer repos call it
from their own CI pipelines — no local tools required, runs fully in GitHub Actions.

## 3.20.0 - 2026-05-09

### Consumer Contribution Kit (#620, #621)

Closes the gap where consumer repos (those with `basecoat-enabled` topic) had no
documented, deliberate path to submit learnings back to basecoat memory.

#### scripts/submit-learning.ps1 — Active Push

New script for consumer repos. Validates the candidate against the four-point scope
policy (generic, durable, actionable, repo-scoped), writes a structured
YAML+Markdown file to `basecoat-memory/sweep-candidates/`, and optionally opens a
steward review PR with `-OpenPR`. Requires `MEMORY_REPO_TOKEN` env var.

#### .basecoat.yml.example — Sweep Config Template

Documented YAML config template for `basecoat-enabled` repos. Covers:
`learning_labels`, `days_back`, `team`, `contact`, `domain`, `auto_pr`.
Copy to `.basecoat.yml` at the repo root to customize sweep behavior.

#### docs/memory/CONTRIBUTING.md — Consumer Guide

End-to-end guide for repo owners: enlistment, passive label-based signals,
`.basecoat.yml` configuration, active push via `submit-learning.ps1`, scope
policy, and the steward feedback loop.

#### Improved Sweep Candidate Format

`sweep-enterprise-memory.ps1` now emits a structured YAML promotion block per
candidate with auto-guessed domain, subject key, Evidence URL, Does NOT apply to
section, and a four-point scope checklist. Stewards can copy-paste directly to
`memories/{domain}/{subject}.md` — no longer authoring from scratch.

## 3.19.0 - 2026-05-09

### Memory Lifecycle Completion

#### Memory Audit Script — scripts/audit-memories.ps1 (#607, #609, #610)

New script with four modes covering the full memory governance lifecycle:

- **`-Validate`** — checks all `basecoat-memory` memory files for frontmatter
  completeness, fact ≤ 300 chars, `domain:key` subject format, and scope policy
  markers (rejects project-specific technology names). CI-safe, exits 1 on violations.
- **`-Audit`** — scans for stale memories (configurable day threshold, default 180)
  and low-confidence (< 0.50) memories. With `-OpenPR`, moves stale memories to
  `deprecated/{domain}/` via a PR in `basecoat-memory`.
- **`-Update`** — appends new evidence to an existing memory, bumps `last_validated`,
  opens a PR.
- **`-Purge`** — moves a memory to `deprecated/{domain}/` with a deprecation note,
  opens a PR.

#### Memory Audit Workflow — .github/workflows/memory-audit.yml (#609)

Quarterly schedule (1 Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct) + `workflow_dispatch`. Runs `-Validate` on
every scheduled run and `-Audit` on demand. `-OpenPR` input triggers automated
deprecation PR creation for stale memories.

#### Loopback: High-Confidence Hot-Index Promotion (#608)

`contribute-memories.ps1` now detects memories with `confidence >= 0.90` after pushing
and emits a clear list of hot-index promotion candidates, closing the feedback loop
from session memory → shared memory → L2 hot cache.

#### Sprint-20 Memory Payload — docs/memory/sprint-20-memories.json (#611)

Eight valid basecoat-scoped patterns from sprints 15–20, structured for immediate
contribution via `contribute-memories.ps1`. Covers: CI quirks, git hygiene, agent/skill
authoring conventions, sprint workflow, task classification, memory scope policy, and
markdown lint patterns.

## 3.18.0 - 2026-05-09

### Memory Contribution Pipeline

#### Memory Contribution Script — scripts/contribute-memories.ps1 (#602)

New batch export script that reads a JSON array of session memory facts and creates
structured `memories/{domain}/{subject}.md` files in `{org}/basecoat-memory` via the
GitHub API, opening a single PR for steward review. Supports `-DryRun` and `-Force` flags.

#### sync-shared-memory.ps1: add -ExportFile mode (#601)

Added `-ExportFile` parameter. After using `-Export` to generate a template and editing
it, agents can use `-ExportFile /tmp/edit.md -Subject domain:key` to push the file to
`basecoat-memory` on a new branch and open a PR — completing the single-memory contribution
loop without manual `git` operations.

#### Memory Contribute Workflow — .github/workflows/memory-contribute.yml (#603)

New `workflow_dispatch` workflow for agent-triggered batch memory contribution. Accepts
a base64-encoded JSON payload of memory facts, calls `contribute-memories.ps1`, and
emits a job summary. Triggered at sprint end by the coding agent or manually by a steward.

#### Memory Contribution Process Documentation — docs/memory/PROCESS.md (#604)

New document covering the end-to-end pipeline: produce (store_memory) → export
(contribute-memories.ps1 / -ExportFile) → review (PR in basecoat-memory) → promote
(steward merges) → pull (sync-shared-memory.ps1). Includes memory domains taxonomy,
Memory Scope Policy, steward responsibilities, and a scripts/workflows reference.

#### Memory Scope Checklist in memory-index.instructions.md (#605)

Added a four-point checklist (repo-scoped, generic, durable, actionable) agents must
validate before calling `store_memory`. Added `contribute-memory` pattern bundle and
reference link to PROCESS.md. Closes the stale-memory scope-creep issue.

## 3.17.0 - 2026-05-09

### Instruction Trim Completion + Workflow Reliability

#### Fix Copilot Agent Assignment in issue-approve.yml (#596)

Corrected the assignee username from `copilot-swe-agent` to `Copilot` (the correct
GitHub Copilot coding agent username). Added post-assignment verification that re-fetches
the issue and checks the `assignees` list. Posts an honest success or failure comment
with manual instructions when assignment does not stick.

#### GitHub Secrets Operations Runbook (#583)

Created `docs/operations/GITHUB_SECRETS.md` documenting all 4 required repository
secrets (`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_AW_GITHUB_MCP_SERVER_TOKEN`,
`STAGING_API_TOKEN`) with setup steps, required scopes, rotation schedules, and
troubleshooting guidance.

#### Instruction Modularization Batch 3 — 4 Instructions (#584)

  `references/memory-index/memory-algorithms.md`



### Agent Compliance + Instruction Trim

#### Agent Compliance Sweep — All 74 Agents (#581)

Added `allowed_skills` frontmatter, `## Model` body section, and `## Governance`
to all agents that were missing them. Every agent now declares its default model,
model rationale, and governance policy.

- **Batch 1 (10 agents):** sprint-planner, release-manager, domain-designer,
  infrastructure-deploy, self-healing-ci, strategy-to-automation,
  legacy-modernization, dotnet-modernization-advisor, release-impact-advisor, feedback-loop
- **Batch 2 (12 agents):** api-security, secrets-manager, hardening-advisor,
  penetration-test, supply-chain-security, config-auditor, security-monitor,
  security-operations, ha-architect, resilience-reviewer, observability-engineer,
  production-readiness
- **Batch 3 (52 agents):** all remaining agents

Lightweight coordination agents (retro-facilitator, sprint-retrospective,
memory-curator, merge-coordinator, rollout-basecoat, project-onboarding,
new-customization, issue-triage) use `claude-haiku-4.5`.

#### Instruction Modularization Batch 2 — 3 Instructions (#582)

Applied references/ extraction pattern to three large instruction files:

- **data-science.instructions.md** — condensed from 13.3 KB to 3.5 KB; detail in
  `references/data-science/notebook-conventions.md`, `medallion-and-duckdb.md`,
  `feature-engineering-and-training.md`
- **data-workload-testing.instructions.md** — condensed from 11.6 KB to 2.3 KB; detail in
  `references/data-workload-testing/data-quality-tests.md`, `layer-test-patterns.md`
- **mutation-testing.instructions.md** — condensed from 11.5 KB to 2.4 KB; detail in
  `references/mutation-testing/mutation-tools-and-ci.md`, `survival-patterns-and-fixes.md`

#### PowerShell CI Test Job (#585)

Added `test` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `pwsh tests/run-tests.ps1`
on `ubuntu-latest` with artifact upload on failure.

#### Test Fix

Fixed `allowed_skills: []` empty-array validation bug in `tests/agent-integration-tests.ps1`
(PowerShell `return @()` is coerced to `$null` at call site; wrapped with `@(...)` and
added raw-line regex check).

## 3.15.0 - 2026-05-22

### Modularization Sweep + Repo Structure

#### Skill Modularization Batch 3 (6 skills)

Condensed 6 large SKILL.md files (all were 5.2–6.4 KB) to ≤5 KB overview files,
extracting detailed content into `references/` subdirectories per skill.

- **electron-apps** — `process-architecture.md`, `packaging-updates.md`, `testing-security.md`
- **database-migration** — `zero-downtime-patterns.md`, `schema-versioning.md`, `operations-checklist.md`
- **github-security-posture** — `org-checks.md`, `repo-checks.md`
- **contract-testing** — `pact-patterns.md`, `e2e-orchestration.md`
- **azure-waf-review** — `pillar-guide.md`, `workflow-guardrails.md`
- **copilot-usage-analytics** — `api-landscape-detail.md`, `cost-estimation-guide.md`

#### Instruction Modularization Batch 1 (3 instructions)

Applied the same references/ pattern to the three largest instruction files:

- **electron.instructions.md** — condensed from 15.2 KB to 4.2 KB; detail in `references/electron/ipc-security.md` and `csp-child-process.md`
- **nextjs-react19.instructions.md** — condensed from 14.2 KB to 2.4 KB; detail in `references/nextjs/server-components.md` and `app-router.md`
- **agents.instructions.md** — condensed from 14.1 KB to 6.5 KB; detail in `references/agents/skill-pairing.md` and `lifecycle.md`

#### Issue #578 — Internal/Distributable Separation

Added `distribute: false` frontmatter to repo-internal instruction files that should
not be synced to downstream repositories:

- `governance.instructions.md`
- `enterprise-configuration.instructions.md`
- `hrm-execution.instructions.md`
- `token-economics.instructions.md`
- `memory-index.instructions.md`

Sync scripts already honour this flag (validated by test suite). Documented policy
in `CONTRIBUTING.md` under "Asset Distribution". Closes #578.

## 3.14.0 - 2026-05-09

### HRM Formalization + Skill Batch 2 + Memory Intelligence

#### HRM Phase 2 Formal Layer Contracts (`instructions/hrm-execution.instructions.md`)

New instruction file formalizing the Human-Routing-Model Phase 2 adoption path from the TRM/HRM research doc:

- **L0–L4 scope table** — formal input/output contracts and scope constraints per layer
- **EscalationQuery type** — structured object (`intent`, `keywords`, `confidence`, `context_budget_remaining`, `originating_layer`, `reason`) passed between HRM layers
- **Two-dimensional routing matrix** — confidence × context completeness: four routing quadrants from fast path to full HRM traversal
- **Guidance signal catalogue** — 7 signals: `STAY_FAST_PATH`, `EXPAND_CONTEXT`, `ELEVATE_TO_L3`, `ELEVATE_TO_L4`, `TURN_BUDGET_AT_RISK`, `ESCALATE_SCOPE`, `CONFIDENCE_DRIFT`
- **Agent decomposition scope table** — Sprint → Wave → Issue → Task → Sub-task with "can resolve" and "must escalate" columns
- **Cross-layer dependency notation** — `[depends: subject@fact]` comment convention
- Updated `instructions/memory-index.instructions.md` and `instructions/token-economics.instructions.md` with 2D routing matrix references and cross-links

#### TRM Memory Intelligence (`instructions/memory-index.instructions.md`)

- **Pattern bundle Bayesian confidence updates** — `confidence(t) = confidence(t-1) + 0.05 × (outcome(t) - confidence(t-1))`, bounded [0.50, 0.99]; quarterly drift review for bundles drifting > 0.15 from authored value
- **Memory promotion heat scoring** — `heat(t) = 0.85 × heat(t-1) + 0.15 × relevance(t)` where relevance ∈ {1.0 applied, 0.5 loaded, 0.0 not loaded}; `[heat-score: <value>]` inline comment convention for L2 index entries; raw access-count thresholds replaced with heat thresholds

#### Large Skill Modularization Batch 2 (`skills/`)

Applied the `references/` pattern to the next 7 skills by size:

| Skill | Before | After | Reference Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| `identity-migration` | 12.5 KB | ≤5 KB | migration-patterns, azure-integration, testing-checklist |
| `basecoat` | 8.7 KB | ≤5 KB | authoring, governance |
| `tech-debt` | 7.8 KB | ≤5 KB | assessment, remediation |
| `dev-containers` | 7.8 KB | ≤5 KB | configuration, workflows |
| `api-security` | 7.6 KB | ≤5 KB | threat-model, controls |
| `ha-resilience` | 7.2 KB | ≤5 KB | patterns, testing |
| `azure-devops-rest` | 7.0 KB | ≤5 KB | pipelines, extensions |

Each `SKILL.md` is now a ≤5 KB overview + nav table; detailed content lives in `references/*.md`.

#### Dependency Hygiene

- Merged PR #577: esbuild, `@storybook/addon-essentials`, and `@storybook/react` bumps in `portal/ui`

## 3.13.0 - 2026-05-08

### TRM Intelligence + Skill Modularization + MCP Expansion

#### TRM Reflexion Instruction (`instructions/trm-reflexion.instructions.md`)

New instruction file implementing the TRM Phase 1 adoption path from the research doc:

- **Two-pass intent classification** — Pass 1 on L2 trigger map; Pass 2 only in the 0.30–0.79 confidence band; converges immediately at ≥ 0.80 or ≤ 0.30
- **Reflexion failure signal** — structured `REFLEXION` block injected into next pass on repeated misrouting; forces explicit failure reflection before reclassifying
- **Self-consistency cap** — k=3 maximum passes; Pass 3 uses majority vote across all three passes
- **Progress estimator** — exponential moving average `estimate(t) = estimate(t-1)×0.7 + observation(t)×0.3`; fires checkpoint when progress/turns_remaining < 0.6
- **HRM tier integration** — TRM confidence score surfaces alongside fast/full routing decision
- Updated `instructions/token-economics.instructions.md` and `instructions/memory-index.instructions.md` with cross-references to `trm-reflexion.instructions.md`

#### Large Skill Modularization (`skills/`)

Applied the `references/` pattern (proven in `service-bus-migration`) to the top 5 skills by size:

| Skill | Before | After | Reference Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cqrs-event-sourcing` | 19.7 KB | 2.8 KB | command-side, event-sourcing, read-side, sagas-operations |
| `e2e-testing` | 14.1 KB | 1.9 KB | playwright-patterns, cypress-patterns, ci-integration |
| `penetration-testing` | 13.7 KB | 2.5 KB | test-cases, exploitation, reporting |
| `gitops` | 9.5 KB | 2.0 KB | flux-argocd, multi-cluster-secrets |
| `twelve-factor` | 9.5 KB | 2.4 KB | factors-1-6, factors-7-12 |

Each SKILL.md is now a ≤5KB overview with a navigation table; all detail lives in `references/*.md` (≤5KB each).

#### MCP Asset Search Tools (`mcp/basecoat-metrics/src/index.ts`)

Three new tools added to the `basecoat-metrics` MCP server:

- **`search-skills`** — fuzzy (case-insensitive substring) search across all skills by name or description; requires `REPO_DIR`
- **`search-agents`** — same for agents
- **`get-asset-details`** — returns full file content of any skill or agent by relative path; path traversal protection included
- `REPO_DIR` env var documented in `mcp/basecoat-metrics/README.md`; pre-wired in `.vscode/mcp.json` via `${workspaceFolder}`
- `tests/mcp-tests.ps1` updated to validate all three new tools and `REPO_DIR` support

#### Dependency Update Advisor (`agents/`, `.github/workflows/`)

New agentic workflow for automated Dependabot PR triage:

- **`agents/dependency-update-advisor.agent.md`** — defines the full workflow: semver bump detection, breaking change lookup, impact surface analysis, CVE context, structured comment posting
- **`.github/workflows/dependency-update-advisor.yml`** — GitHub Actions workflow triggered on `pull_request: opened` for Dependabot PRs; posts a `🔍 Dependency Update Risk Assessment` comment with risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), breaking change detection from release notes, test focus suggestions, and CVE context

## 3.12.0 - 2026-05-08

### MCP Deployment Infra, Enterprise Memory Sweep, Portal Consolidation

#### MCP Server Deployment (`mcp/basecoat-metrics/`, `infra/mcp/`, `.github/workflows/`)

Full production deployment stack for the `basecoat-metrics` MCP server:

- **`mcp/basecoat-metrics/Dockerfile`** — multi-stage `node:22-alpine` build, non-root `mcp` user, `HEALTHCHECK`, port 8080
- **`mcp/basecoat-metrics/src/index.ts`** — added `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`; HTTP mode when `MCP_TRANSPORT=http` or `NODE_ENV=production`; stdio stays default for local dev
- **`infra/mcp/main.bicep`** — Azure Container Apps + Log Analytics Workspace; scales to zero; HTTPS auto-TLS; liveness + readiness probes; HTTP scaling rule
- **`infra/mcp/README.md`** — one-time setup, service principal creation, manual deploy steps, parameter table
- **`.github/workflows/mcp-build.yml`** — PR gate: `npm ci` → `tsc` → Docker build smoke test → `az bicep build` lint; triggers on `mcp/**` and `infra/mcp/**`
- **`.github/workflows/mcp-deploy.yml`** — on merge to `main`: build + push to GHCR → Bicep deploy → smoke-test `/health`; requires `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and `MCP_RESOURCE_GROUP` secrets
- **`.vscode/mcp.json`** — local stdio + remote HTTP entries for the deployed Azure Container Apps FQDN

#### Enterprise Memory Sweep (`scripts/`, `docs/memory/`, `.github/workflows/`)

Zero-maintenance enterprise repo enlistment and weekly memory extraction:

- **`docs/memory/enlistment.md`** — repo opt-in via `basecoat-enabled` GitHub topic; optional `.basecoat.yml` per-repo config; `MEMORY_REPO_TOKEN` setup guide
- **`scripts/sweep-enterprise-memory.ps1`** — discovers `basecoat-enabled` repos via GitHub API, extracts PR/issue/CHANGELOG signals, writes dated candidate files
- **`.github/workflows/memory-sweep.yml`** — weekly sweep (Monday 06:00 UTC); writes to `{org}/basecoat-memory` (separate repo), opens PR there for human review; two-token pattern: `GITHUB_TOKEN` for reads, `MEMORY_REPO_TOKEN` for writes

#### Portal Consolidation (`portal/`)

- Moved `portal-ui/` → `portal/ui/` via `git mv` (full history preserved)
- `portal/README.md` rewritten as monorepo index documenting `frontend/`, `backend/`, `ui/`, `prompts/`

## 3.10.0 - 2026-05-08

### Bootstrap, Agentic Workflows Tier 1-2, Azure Instructions, Shared Org Memory

#### Bootstrap (`scripts/bootstrap.ps1`)

New idempotent 4-phase setup script for new BaseCoat adopters:

- **Phase 1 — Repo setup**: fork/clone detection, `gh` CLI check, `gh aw` extension install prompt, GitHub Actions status verification
- **Phase 2 — Memory layer**: `.gitignore` guard for SQLite/session-state files, `.memory/` directory init, optional shared org memory sync
- **Phase 3 — Secrets checklist**: `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` presence check, `BASECOAT_SHARED_MEMORY_REPO` config, `version.json` readability
- **Phase 4 — Validation**: runs `validate-basecoat.ps1` + `tests/run-tests.ps1`; actionable error list on failure
- Flags: `-Silent` (CI use), `-SkipTests`, `-SharedMemoryRepo`

#### Agentic Workflows — Tier 2 (`.github/workflows/`)

New `security-analyst.md` + compiled `security-analyst.lock.yml`:

- Triggers on `pull_request: [opened, synchronize]`
- Performs OWASP Top 10 spot check scoped to PR diff, secret scan, dependency risk assessment
- Posts a severity-ranked findings table only when issues are found — no noise on clean PRs
- Completes the Tier 1+2 agentic workflow set: `issue-triage`, `retro-facilitator`, `self-healing-ci`, `code-review-agent`, `release-impact-advisor`, `security-analyst`

#### Azure Instructions

- **`instructions/azure-service-connector.instructions.md`**: managed identity authentication (system/user-assigned), Key Vault references for secrets, Bicep `Microsoft.ServiceLinker/linkers` patterns, standard environment variable names, connection validation
- **`instructions/azure-app-configuration.instructions.md`**: key naming hierarchy (`{service}/{component}/{key}` + labels), feature flags with safe defaults, dynamic refresh with sentinel key, `disableLocalAuth`, purge protection, private endpoints, SDK usage pattern (.NET example)

#### Shared Org Memory Repo

- Created `IBuySpy-Shared/basecoat-memory` private repo — the shared L2s/L3s memory tier for the org
- Seeded from `docs/templates/basecoat-memory/`: README, CONTRIBUTING, hot-index, validate-memory CI workflow
- Sync via `scripts/sync-shared-memory.ps1 -SharedMemoryRepo IBuySpy-Shared/basecoat-memory`

## 3.9.0 - 2026-05-07

### Adaptive Execution Hierarchy + Memory Fast-Path Routing

#### Execution Hierarchy (`docs/execution-hierarchy.md`)

New reference document defining the 5-layer execution stack for all BaseCoat agents:

- **Layer 0** — System instructions (host/provider, immutable)
- **Layer 1** — BaseCoat guardrails as structural circuit breakers (governance, security, agent-behavior); fire at fixed checkpoints regardless of fast/full path — cannot be routed around
- **Layer 2** — Intent classification using L2 memory index (zero extra context cost); routes to fast path or full path based on confidence score
- **Layer 3a Fast Path** — Pattern bundle loaded for known intents (confidence ≥ 0.80); pre-scoped context + pre-validated turn budget
- **Layer 3b Full Path** — Layered context load for novel/low-confidence tasks; L2 → L3 episodic → L4 semantic
- **Layer 5** — Post-execution learning: reinforce successful novel patterns to memory; log failure patterns on stuck tasks

Pattern bundle catalog: 9 known BaseCoat patterns with turn budgets and confidence lifecycle (degrades on overruns, retires below 0.50).

#### Memory Lookup Hierarchy (`instructions/memory-index.instructions.md`)

New L2 hot-cache instruction file — loads at session start to prime fast recall:

- L0–L4 tier map with retrieval cost per tier
- Promotion ladder: `store_memory` accessed 3× → L2 index; 5 sessions → L1 instruction rule; >50% sessions → L0 frontmatter
- Pinned patterns exempt from decay (security, governance)
- Trigger map organized by domain (CI, testing, portal, git, assets, turn budget)
- Episodic retrieval SQL shortcuts for L3 queries

#### Turn Budget and Learning Cost (`instructions/token-economics.instructions.md`)

- Classify tasks as **Routine** (≤3 turns), **Familiar** (≤5 turns), or **Novel** (estimate N) before starting
- **Failure protocol**: after 5 turns with no measurable forward progress → `store_memory` failure pattern, change approach before escalating model tier
- **Success protocol**: novel solution + tests pass → `store_memory`; skip for boilerplate
- **80/50 early-warning rule**: at 80% turn budget with <50% progress → pause and reassess
- Intent-first context loading replaces static layered order

#### Memory Schema Extensions (`docs/SQLITE_MEMORY.md`)

- Added columns: `tier` (l0–l4), `heat` (cold/warm/hot), `pinned`, `promotion_count`, `last_promoted_at`
- Heat thresholds: cold (0–2 accesses), warm (3–9), hot (10+)
- Pinned flag exempts memories from decay and demotion

#### Memory Curator Agent (`agents/memory-curator.agent.md`)

- L0–L4 lookup hierarchy with retrieval cost per tier
- Promotion protocol (myelination): access frequency drives tier promotion
- Heat-based proactive injection: hot memories injected at session start when domain matches
- Resolution order for SessionStart and PostToolUse failure paths

#### Plan-First Workflow (`instructions/plan-first.instructions.md`)

- Phase 0 (Intent Classification) added before Explore phase
- Fast-path tasks skip directly to Plan using bundle context
- Guardrails still fire at structural checkpoints on all paths

## 3.8.0 - 2026-05-07

### Sprint 11 — GitHub Agentic Workflows + Portal Scan Trigger

#### Agentic Workflows (`gh aw`)

Five BaseCoat agents converted to GitHub Agentic Workflows that run automatically
inside GitHub Actions. Each workflow is a `.md` source file compiled to a
`.lock.yml` with the `gh aw` framework's defense-in-depth security model
(read-only agent job → threat detection → safe-output execution).

- **`issue-triage`** — fires on `issues: opened`; classifies issue type, applies
  priority labels (`P0`–`P3`), and posts a triage summary comment (#562)
- **`retro-facilitator`** — `schedule: weekly`; analyzes closed issues and merged
  PRs for the past 7 days and creates a structured Went Well / Improve / Action
  Items retrospective issue (#563)
- **`self-healing-ci`** — fires on `workflow_run: failed`; fetches failed job logs
  and posts a root-cause diagnosis with remediation steps (#564)
- **`release-impact-advisor`** — fires on `pull_request: opened`; assesses blast
  radius, rollback complexity, and risks for the PR diff (#566)
- **`code-review-agent`** — fires on `pull_request: [opened, synchronize]`; reviews
  the diff for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and logic errors with
  high signal-to-noise ratio (#567)

#### Portal — Scan Trigger

- **Trigger Scan button** in `RepositoryDetail` — POST `/api/v1/repositories/:id/scans`,
  disabled while running, error banner on failure (#565)
- **`useScanPoller` hook** — polls `GET /api/v1/scans/:id` every 3s until
  `completed` or `failed`; auto-refreshes scan history table (#565)
- **Scan running badge** — visual indicator while polling is active (#565)
- **Backend stub runner** — scan transitions `running → completed` via 5s timeout,
  enabling end-to-end demo without a live scanner (#565)
- **20 tests** — 6 `useScanPoller` unit tests + 14 `RepositoryDetail` tests (#565)

#### Documentation

- **`docs/agentic-workflows.md`** — `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` PAT setup guide,
  workflow authoring instructions, security model overview, allowed-expressions
  reference

#### Security

- Bump `path-to-regexp` 8.3.0 → 8.4.2 in `/mcp` (#559)

## 3.7.0 - 2026-05-07

### Sprint 10 — Portal UX, Docker Deployment, and Plugin Docs

- **npm publish config** — Added `files`, `publishConfig`, `keywords`, `repository`, and `engines` to `plugins/copilot-cli-plugin/package.json` (#551)
- **`.npmignore`** — Excludes test files, source maps, and dev configs from published package (#551)

#### CI / Agent Quality

- **Sync test robustness** — `Invoke-SyncToConsumer` now creates a temp named branch for `git clone` instead of using detached-HEAD ref; works in all CI states (PR merge commits, tag checkouts, shallow clones)
- **Agent output sections** — Fixed `## Key Outputs` → `## Output` in `api-security`, `database-migration`, `e2e-test-strategy`, and `gitops-engineer` agents to satisfy word-boundary CI validation
- **CRLF fix** — `skills/azure-container-apps/SKILL.md` converted to LF

- Model routing table in `agents.instructions.md` aligned with `model-routing.instructions.md` (claude-sonnet-4.6 for standard tier)
- `azure/login@v1` → `@v2` in environment-bootstrap skill
- BinaryFormatter (RCE vector) replaced with System.Text.Json in service-bus-migration skill
- ClientSecret patterns in identity-migration skill now include security warnings and use env vars
- ADR path standardized to `docs/adr/` in architecture.instructions.md
- Self-merge policy clarified — permitted when repo policy allows

- 3 agents with fictional tools replaced with real platform tools: legacy-modernization, infrastructure-deploy, release-impact-advisor

### Added
- `AGENTS.md` — root-level file listing all 50 agents for cross-tool AI agent discovery
- `context: fork` frontmatter added to 6 large skills (>5KB) for efficient VS Code context management
- Domain-specific sections added to 3 stub agents: code-review (review checklist), new-customization (decision tree), rollout-basecoat (distribution channels)

## 2.1.1 - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Sync scripts no longer copy agent taxonomy subdirs (`models/`, `orchestrator/`, `tasks/`, `types/`) to consumer repos — these contained only index READMEs with broken relative links
- `.github/agents/` Copilot discovery path now receives only flat `*.agent.md` files (no subdirs)
- Package Base Coat workflow no longer skips jobs on tag push — `validate-basecoat.yml` now accepts a `concurrency_group` input to prevent collisions with simultaneous push-to-main validate runs

### Changed
- `docs/goals.md` — updated for v2.1.0 (agent counts, model frontmatter, process discipline)

### Fixed
- `sync.ps1` / `sync.sh` now copy `skills/` to `.github/skills/` for VS Code auto-discovery (was missing — 33 skills were invisible to VS Code)
- `sync.ps1` / `sync.sh` now sync `docs/` to consumer repos (fixes broken guardrail doc references)
- Removed premature CATALOG/INVENTORY entries referencing uncommitted files

### Changed
- `CATALOG.md` — added 15 agents, 7 skills, 15 instructions
